Project Description
------
This project was created as a mini project in General Assembly's Web Development Immersive Program (Sept. 2014). It was scoped and developed over a weekend. 

Installation
------
This app requires an Amazon Web Services API key and an S3 bucket name. The AWS secret keys must be initialized in `config/environments/[environment].rb`, and also in the article model, since I'm using Thoughtbot's [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) gem. 

Once you fork and clone, run `rake db:create db:migrate`, fire up your rails server, and navigate to localhost:3000. TheBlog should prompt you to create a new user.
